/**
 * @brief These are a subset of the various sensortype mappings for the Aretas API
 * 
 * The REST API describes metadata for 100s of different sensor types including
 * char codes, labels, descriptions, safe ranges, AI/ML hints, recommendations, units, etc, etc.
 * 
 * To access the raw metadata in JSON format you can query the open REST endpoint here:
 * 
 * https://iot.aretas.ca/rest/sensortype/list
 * 
 * Not all sensor types are available through the API (only the public enabled ones and not the ones that users override or provide in their own accounts)
 * And not every sensor type has full metadata populated
 * 
 * When you emit these types from firmware to the REST endpoint or to a middleware application, these types are somewhat important for routing (in the middleware)
 * and for analytics / ML / AI / Alerting / etc. in the Cloud service
 * 
 * To request additional metadata annotations for new sensor types, contact team-aretas@aretas.ca 
 *
